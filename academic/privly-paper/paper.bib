@misc{Arthur2010,
abstract = {A piece of software called Haystack, which claimed to be an "anti-censorship" system to let people in Iran use the internet anonymously, has been withdrawn by its author after experts raised serious questions about its security. The author, Austin Heap, a 26-year-old programmer from San Francisco, has been roundly criticised by professionals who complain that he has never allowed them access to the program's code – which they say is a necessity with security software to check whether it can do what it claims. After having obtained access by other means, the experts now say that instead of making users anonymous, it could reveal key information about them to the Iranian authorities. In a post on his blog on Monday, Heap says that in the "vigorous debate" about Haystack's security "many of the points made were valid" and that users have been asked to stop using it. Daniel Colascione, who worked with Heap and says he came up with the "Haystack" name, tweeted on Tuesday that the Censorship Research Center (CRC) that he co-created with Heap to host Haystack is now being wound down. But he also maintained that the software that has been criticised was not intended for widespread use, and was only a test version. In March the US government granted Haystack an export licence, required for "sensitive" cryptographic software, following a fast-track approval process which does not seem to have included independent verification of its security. Haystack, and Heap, won plaudits from a number of organisations after the software's release last year. Its genesis followed the Iranian protests at the presidential election there in 2009, which was widely felt to have been rigged. Many people there tried to use mobile phones and services such as Twitter to organise protests, but there were also fears they could be traced by the authorities, using software in mobile transmission systems sold by western companies such as Nokia. The idea of Haystack was to make communications by its users look like innocent – rather than sensitive – information. Heap developed it so that Iranian users could use email and web services such as Twitter without the Iranian authorities being able to trace them.},

abstract = {Third parties, in particular advertisers, have accidentally had access to Facebook users’ accounts including profiles, photographs, chat, and also had the ability to post messages and mine personal information. Fortunately, these third-parties may not have realized their ability to access this information. We have reported this issue to Facebook, who has taken corrective action to help eliminate this issue. Facebook applications are Web applications that are integrated onto the Facebook platform. According to Facebook, 20 million Facebook applications are installed every day. Symantec has discovered that in certain cases, Facebook IFRAME applications inadvertently leaked access tokens to third parties like advertisers or analytic platforms. We estimate that as of April 2011, close to 100,000 applications were enabling this leakage. We estimate that over the years, hundreds of thousands of applications may have inadvertently leaked millions of access tokens to third parties. Access tokens are like ‘spare keys’ granted by you to the Facebook application. Applications can use these tokens or keys to perform certain actions on behalf of the user or to access the user’s profile. Each token or ‘spare key’ is associated with a select set of permissions, like reading your wall, accessing your friend’s profile, posting to your wall, etc.},

abstract = {There is so much emphasis on monitoring and analyzing written communication across the web and insocial media. Online listening has become a standard for many companies and brands, but what is thenext frontier? What are we missing? Photos that consumers upload and share amongstthemselves are a major missing piece of the online listening pie. The numbers speak for themselves. By the end of 2010, more than 80 billion photos were uploadedacross a variety of social picture platforms (source: Pixable;Facebook Photo Trends). At least once amonth, 52\% of mobile users take photos with their phones and 19\% upload their photos to the web atleast once a month (source: comScore MobiLens January 2011: 3 month average). Photo sharingbehavior amongst consumers is especially important to look at when creating marketing programstargeted towards women; they are twice as likely than their male counterparts to upload, tag and viewphotos (source: Pixable;Facebook Photo Trends).The analysis that follows looks specifically at photos shared by consumers relating to food, eating, andmeals. The food photo sharing phenomenon is in full swing with new tools popping up all the time, suchas Foodspotting, Fiddme, Eat.ly, and the recently added photo capabilities to Foursquare. Showing - not just telling - others what you’re eating is becoming mainstream.In this POV we explore the habits and motivations of people sharing food photos online by examining thecontent of UGC photos and what this phenomenon means for food-related marketers and brands.},

abstract = {I have been very vocal, from the very beginning, about my gratitude and debt to The Quiet Earth (hi, Gordon!), and my appreciation for the Redditors who offered expertise and suggestions. That said: the story that went to Warner Brothers is not the same as the story posted on Reddit. It has a lot of the same DNA, mind you, and it feels like RSR because it's my writing. This is totally okay with me for two reasons. One, the story I was setting up was not super cinematic - hard to get through a lot of what I was gestating in two hours. Two, someday when it's not going to conflict with what goes up in the movie, what I was setting up can be completed as fan fiction. What I'm saying is you're not going to see Day Nine on the silver screen. But you will see it on Reddit someday.},

abstract = {This study explores an under-studied layer of Chinese Internet censorship: how Chinese Internet companies censor user–generated content, usually by deleting it or preventing its publication. Systematic testing of Chinese blog service providers reveals that domestic censorship is very decentralized with wide variation from company to company. Test results also showed that a great deal of politically sensitive material survives in the Chinese blogosphere, and that chances for its survival can likely be improved with knowledge and strategy. The study concludes that choices and actions by private individuals and companies can have a significant impact on the overall balance of freedom and control in the Chinese blogosphere.},

abstract = {Online social networks (OSNs) are immensely popular, with some claiming over 200 million users. Users share private content, such as personal information or photographs, using OSN applications. Users must trust the OSN service to protect personal information even as the OSN provider benefits from examining and sharing that information. We present Persona, an OSN where users dictate who may access their information. Persona hides user data with attribute-based encryption (ABE), allowing users to apply fine-grained policies over who may view their data. Persona provides an effective means of creating applications in which users, not the OSN, define policy over access to private data. We demonstrate new cryptographic mechanisms that enhance the general applicability of ABE. We show how Persona provides the functionality of existing online social networks with additional privacy benefits. We describe an implementation of Persona that replicates Facebook applications and show that Persona provides acceptable performance when browsing privacy-enhanced web pages, even on mobile devices.},
