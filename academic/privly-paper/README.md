# Becoming an Author

Academia has strict unwritten rules regarding credit assignment for journal and conference papers. Consequently, you don't often see open source projects publishing refereed papers. When an open source project does decide to publish, they might regress to a closed development model where they submit the paper to the editor, then send it to the community. We hope to bring academic publishing to the open source world but to strike a balance between academic propriety and openess we are reserving copyright for the paper materials. That said, we are open to taking additional authors should they have an "itch they want to scratch."
