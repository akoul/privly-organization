### Copyright and Trademark

If you're making non-commercial use of Privly software, you may use the Privly logo (as an illustration, not as a brand for your products). Please don't modify the design or colors of the logo. You can use items that look like the Privly logo to illustrate a point (e.g. the Privly logo in composition with a browser, for instance), so long as they're not used as logos in ways that would confuse people.

Does this mean you're enforcing trademark rights?

The Privly Foundation is a non-profit corporation organized to research and develop the Privly privacy software and network. We don't want to be trademark bullies, but we will use trademark to protect the public's ability to recognize Privly Project software. Trademark law helps us to assure that the name is used only in connection with genuine Privly privacy software and for accurate description of software and services. After all, to protect their privacy securely, computer users must be able to identify the software they are using, so they can account properly for its strengths and weaknesses. We work with developers to improve the software and actively encourage researchers to document attacks to help us strengthen its privacy protection further. We distribute the software itself freely, but require correct attribution.
